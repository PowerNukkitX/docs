# Hardware Compression Acceleration

Hardware compression acceleration is an optional function provided by PNX, which can accelerate data compression by using hardware SIMD on modern CPUs.

## Why?

PNX is suitable for large servers. Many PNX servers host dozens or even hundreds of players at the same time, which means that each player generates a large amount of data. Due to the requirements of the Bedrock version, this data needs to be compressed before it can be sent to players.
Additionally, when players run maps, a large amount of map data is generated and also needs to be compressed and decompressed frequently.
This data that needs to be compressed or decompressed consumes a lot of CPU resources. Using hardware compression and decompression acceleration can greatly improve performance.

## What CPUs can enable this?

If your CPU can enable hardware-accelerated compression, PNX will notify you at startup.

When your CPU supports one or more of the following instruction sets, hardware-accelerated compression can be enabled. The more instruction sets supported, the greater the performance improvement:

| Instruction Set | Explanation |
|-----------------|-------------|
| AVX512          | Intel/AMD   |
| AVX2            | Intel/AMD   |
| AVX             | Intel/AMD   |
| SSE4.2          | Intel/AMD   |
| SSE4.1          | Intel/AMD   |
| SSSE3           | Intel/AMD   |
| SSE3            | Intel/AMD   |
| SSE2            | Intel/AMD   |
| SSE             | Intel/AMD   |
| SVE             | ARMv8.2+    |
| NEON            | ARMv7+      |

## How to enable it?

<Steps>
    ### Modify the configuration file `nukkit.yml`.
    ### Set `zlib-provider` in `network` to `3`.
    ### Here is what it looks like:

    ```yaml filename="nukkit.yml"
    network:
    zlib-provider: 3
    ```
