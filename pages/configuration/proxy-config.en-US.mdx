# Proxy config
Use proxy, you can fast transfer player between multiple servers,
which is especially important for setting a group of servers. In Bedrock Edition,
the most popular proxy currently is [WaterdogPe](https://github.com/WaterdogPE/WaterdogPE).
PNX has made a adaptation version for it: [WaterdogPe-PNX](https://github.com/PowerNukkitX/WaterdogPE-PNX).

Next, we introduce how to use WaterdogPE in PNX.
## Usage

You only need to adjust the `nukkit.yml` in each PNX sub-server by setting `waterdogpe=true` to use WaterdogPE.
